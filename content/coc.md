# Code of Conduct

**Antonio Schettino** (schettino@eur.nl)

## Mission
The Open Science Community Rotterdam (OSCR) organizes and promotes formal and informal events and meetings to discuss open and transparent scientific practices (also termed open science, OS). OSCR has three main goals:

1. facilitate communication and sharing of information on OS;
2. increase and speed up the practical adoption of OS;
3. build professional networks and foster scientific collaborations, with OS as an integral part of research.

The community is mainly composed by academic and support staff working at Erasmus University Rotterdam and Erasmus Medical Center. However, it also welcomes other interested individuals and entities that share its common goals.


## Inclusivity Statement

OSCR aims to provide a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, age, appearance, religion, or other group status. OSCR fosters diversity, equity, inclusion, and the free expression of ideas. We seek to provide a platform in which participants may learn, discuss, and enjoy each othersâ€™ company in an environment of mutual respect.


## Non-Harassment Policy

We do not tolerate harassments in any form. We recognize a shared responsibility to create and hold that environment for the benefit of all; therefore, some behaviors are specifically prohibited:

* harassment or intimidation (verbal or physical) based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, age, appearance, religion, or other group status;
* sexual harassment or intimidation, including unwelcome sexual attention, stalking (physical or virtual), or unsolicited physical contact;
* harassing photography or recording;
* sustained disruption of events;
* threatening event organizers (verbally or physically).

Organizers are asked to frame discussions as openly and inclusively as possible and to be aware of how language or specific sounds and images may be perceived by others.

Critical examination of beliefs and viewpoints does not, by itself, constitute hostile conduct or harassment. Similarly, use of sexual imagery or language in the context of a professional discussion might not constitute hostile conduct or harassment if necessary to the topic of discussion and presented respectfully.


## Policy Enforcement

Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all events and event-related social activities. Violations of this code of conduct may lead to termination of OSCR membership.


## Reporting Misconduct

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or if you believe a harassment problem exists, please report it as soon as possible to dr. Antonio Schettino (schettino@eur.nl) and/or the organizers of that specific event. You may report your concerns anonymously. Every complaint will be fully investigated and appropriate actions will swiftly be taken to prevent a recurrence. When making a personal report, we will make sure your statement is managed properly and respectfully. You will not be asked to confront anyone and we will not disclose your identity to anyone.
