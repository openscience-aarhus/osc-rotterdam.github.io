# Next DPECS Colloquium

### Team science for psychological theory: a many modelers approach

**Speaker**: [Noah van Dongen](https://nnnvd.wordpress.com/), University of Amsterdam

**Time**: **Tuesday 7 December 2021, 13:00 - 14:00**

**Location**: T13-67 (hybrid event)

**Abstract:** In recent years, a shift has become noticeable, a shift from the lone scientific genius or small localized groups of researchers to global, large-scale collaborations. Though, this emerging team-science has somewhat lopsided. Its focus has been on confirmatory research and replication studies, while exploratory research and theory development have been neglected. At the Theory Methods Lab, Â we wish for a broader scope and attempt a contribution by developing user-friendly tools and schemes for theory construction. One avenue is the many-modelers approach for differential theory formalization, where teams of modelers and substantive researchers attempt to specify and formalize the same theory. During this colloquium, I will A) explain our reasoning behind this approach; B) go through our proof-of-principle attempt; and C) I would like to discuss with you the potential benefits and pitfalls of simultaneously developing a diverse set of theory specifications.
