# Who are we?

Open Science Community Rotterdam (_**OSCR**_) comprises of academics and support staff working at Erasmus University Rotterdam ([_**EUR**_](https://www.eur.nl/en)) and Erasmus Medical Center ([_**ErasmusMC**_](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/)). Our common goal is to promote and adopt open and transparent scientific practices at every stage of the research cycle, from the initial idea to the final product.

**OSCR** is part of a growing national network of communities including [Amsterdam](https://twitter.com/OSCAmsterdam), [Eindhoven](https://twitter.com/OSCEindhoven), [Groningen](https://twitter.com/OSCGroningen), [Leiden](https://twitter.com/OSCLeiden), [Nijmegen](https://twitter.com/OSCNijmegen), [Tilburg](https://twitter.com/OpenTilburg), and [Utrecht](https://twitter.com/OpenSciUtrecht).
