      <description>Description My current research focuses on the development of predictive and prescriptive analytics to address key business decisions. I am particularly interested in the design of new methodologies that can guide organizations in their customer-centric decision making. My research portfolio has been organized according to the three fundamental stages of the customer lifecycle: (i) customer acquisition and new product introduction, (ii) customer development and engagement, and (iii) customer retention. A substantial part of my research involves machine learning and large-scale cluster and grid computing.</description>

      <description>Description My background is applied economics, specifically health economics. My work focuses on opportunity costs in the economic evaluation on health care interventions. I use predominantly pre-collected aggregate data sets, however I also have some experience with Big Data and Survey Data.
I’m fairly new to the Open Science environment, and I am most interested in learning about data management, preregistration and reproducibility.
