      <description>Broadly defined, Open Science aims to make the products of scholarly investigation accessible to as many people as possible. In empirical sciences, one of these products is data analysis. How can you build your analysis pipeline in a way that can easily be inspected, so that results can be reproduced both by novices and experts? With R, of course! üòÑ
The OSCR is happy to announce an online workshop entitled A Tour Around the Tidyverse World.</description>

      <description>Description Eduard is a postdoc in the SYNC lab. A central question in his research is: Why do most teenagers grow up to be kind to others while a proportion engage in harmful, antisocial and risky behaviors? He is very much interested in how we can address these questions using neuroimaging methods in a robust, reproducible way. His main focus as a postdoc at Erasmus University will be to determine the optimal sample size in developmental studies for a range of fMRI tasks.</description>

      <description>Description Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the field of strategic leadership and corporate governance. I am interested in developing our understanding of directors‚Äô appointments and motivation to accept this job position. As an early stage scholar (PhD candidate), I am moving my first steps into open science and I look forward to seeing it developing while being a part of it.

      <description>Our first online ReproducibiliTea Rotterdam was a great success! Thirty people joined our Zoom meeting to discuss with Anne Scheel her preprint comparing the standard psychology literature with Registered Reports. The presentation was awesome, the questions insightful, and the atmosphere light and informal. Thanks to everyone involved!
Given the strong interest and current relevance of open science as a set of tools to quickly disseminate knowledge, the OSCR will host an online webinar entitled Introduction to Git(Hub).</description>

      <description>Description I have a strong interest in methods that facilitate high quality research: reproducible, replicable, relevant, and communicated in a clear and responsible manner also to non-scientific audiences. In terms of substantive interests, my research focuses on dynamic aspects of consumer decision making, more specifically on how preferences evolve over time until a final choice is expressed. In order to gain access to these latent processes, I am using dynamic Bayesian models calibrated on eye-tracking data, building on research in neuroeconomics that supports a strong link between attention and decision making.</description>

      <description>Description I specialize in Multilevel Analysis, Bayesian statistics, Timeseries, Network Analysis, and Diary Studies. My research theme is ‚ÄúInter-individual differences in intra-individual variability. How do individuals change over time, and how does this change differ between individuals?‚Äù.
I mainly work on longitudinal modeling and simulation studies, but also collaborate with substantive researchers and PhD‚Äôs (mainly form the field of Psychology, Child- and Educational Sciences) whenever I can.

      <description>Description My current research focuses on the development of predictive and prescriptive analytics to address key business decisions. I am particularly interested in the design of new methodologies that can guide organizations in their customer-centric decision making. My research portfolio has been organized according to the three fundamental stages of the customer lifecycle: (i) customer acquisition and new product introduction, (ii) customer development and engagement, and (iii) customer retention. A substantial part of my research involves machine learning and large-scale cluster and grid computing.</description>

      <description>Description My research considers both substantive and methodological questions in behavioral research. I conduct experiments to study whether and how people‚Äôs decisions (e.g., what to buy, whom to donate) deviate from the prescriptions of rational choice theory and consequentialist philosophy. I also do research into the methodology of data collection in the behavioral sciences, and in particular the use of online samples (e.g., MTurk).

      <description>Description I‚Äôm a psychologist and teaching statistics at the EUR. As an experimental psychologist, my research interest focuses on the cognitive representation of numbers and mental arithmetics, the role of sensorimotor codes in knowledge representations as well as Bayesian approaches to data analyses and computational modelling.
I‚Äôm actively promoting the idea of Open Science in all my research activities and have been part of several large-scale replication projects. I‚Äôm especially interested in methodological issues and problems of data sharing and the question of data integrity in open science.</description>

      <description>Description I have a background in experimental psychology, cognitive and affective electrophysiology. During my academic career, I investigated the relationship between emotions and visual perception using a wide range of methodological and statistical tools. I adopted transparent and open science practices at every stage of the research cycle, from the preregistration of the initial idea to the publication of the final manuscript in peer-reviewed open access journals.
As Coordinator of the Open Science Community Rotterdam, I facilitate communications between members of the community, organize events and workshops, communicate such activities on social media, and personally support individual researchers and research groups with day-to-day activities related to open science.</description>
