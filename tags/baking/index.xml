      <description>Description Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the field of strategic leadership and corporate governance. I am interested in developing our understanding of directorsâ€™ appointments and motivation to accept this job position. As an early stage scholar (PhD candidate), I am moving my first steps into open science and I look forward to seeing it developing while being a part of it.
