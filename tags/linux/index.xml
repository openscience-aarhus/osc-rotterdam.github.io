      <description>Description I specialize in Multilevel Analysis, Bayesian statistics, Timeseries, Network Analysis, and Diary Studies. My research theme is “Inter-individual differences in intra-individual variability. How do individuals change over time, and how does this change differ between individuals?”.
I mainly work on longitudinal modeling and simulation studies, but also collaborate with substantive researchers and PhD’s (mainly form the field of Psychology, Child- and Educational Sciences) whenever I can.

      <description>Description I’m a psychologist and teaching statistics at the EUR. As an experimental psychologist, my research interest focuses on the cognitive representation of numbers and mental arithmetics, the role of sensorimotor codes in knowledge representations as well as Bayesian approaches to data analyses and computational modelling.
I’m actively promoting the idea of Open Science in all my research activities and have been part of several large-scale replication projects. I’m especially interested in methodological issues and problems of data sharing and the question of data integrity in open science.</description>
