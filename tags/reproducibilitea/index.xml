      <description>As many of you know, OSCR recently started a ReproducibiliTea journal club (for details on the initiative, see a previous blog post). Seven people attended our first meeting (on November 13th): everyone was interested and engaged, thanks to a cozy and informal environment conducive of open debateâ€¦ we could not have started in a better way! This nice atmosphere sparked very interesting discussions, one of which is the topic of our next meeting.</description>
