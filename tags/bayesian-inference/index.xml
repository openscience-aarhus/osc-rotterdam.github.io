      <description>Description I am a PhD candidate at the Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences. My research focuses on the use of psychological insights for public policy (behavioural public policy). For this, I am part of the Behavioural Insights Group Rotterdam. In this group behavioural scientists like me work together with policy experts from the municipality of Rotterdam on case studies submitted by the municipality.
I have experience with conducting field experiments and evaluation studies.</description>

      <description>Description I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Public Administration and Sociology. In my research, I look at interest groups and regulatory politics using quantitative text analysis and statistics. I am fairly new to open science. I have published in an open access journal and use open source software (R) for my analysis.
