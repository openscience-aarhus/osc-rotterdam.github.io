      <description>Description Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the field of strategic leadership and corporate governance. I am interested in developing our understanding of directors’ appointments and motivation to accept this job position. As an early stage scholar (PhD candidate), I am moving my first steps into open science and I look forward to seeing it developing while being a part of it.

      <description>Description I have a strong interest in methods that facilitate high quality research: reproducible, replicable, relevant, and communicated in a clear and responsible manner also to non-scientific audiences. In terms of substantive interests, my research focuses on dynamic aspects of consumer decision making, more specifically on how preferences evolve over time until a final choice is expressed. In order to gain access to these latent processes, I am using dynamic Bayesian models calibrated on eye-tracking data, building on research in neuroeconomics that supports a strong link between attention and decision making.</description>

      <description>Description My current research focuses on the development of predictive and prescriptive analytics to address key business decisions. I am particularly interested in the design of new methodologies that can guide organizations in their customer-centric decision making. My research portfolio has been organized according to the three fundamental stages of the customer lifecycle: (i) customer acquisition and new product introduction, (ii) customer development and engagement, and (iii) customer retention. A substantial part of my research involves machine learning and large-scale cluster and grid computing.</description>

      <description>Description My research considers both substantive and methodological questions in behavioral research. I conduct experiments to study whether and how people’s decisions (e.g., what to buy, whom to donate) deviate from the prescriptions of rational choice theory and consequentialist philosophy. I also do research into the methodology of data collection in the behavioral sciences, and in particular the use of online samples (e.g., MTurk).

      <description>Description My research considers questions in the areas of entertainment and information goods, digital advertising, and other online phenomena. I am especially interested in settings where information, learning, and other types of adaptation affect choice. I am also interested in meta-science, and have an active research stream studying how behavioral scientists conduct experiments.
