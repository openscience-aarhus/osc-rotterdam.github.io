      <description>Description My background is applied economics, specifically health economics. My work focuses on opportunity costs in the economic evaluation on health care interventions. I use predominantly pre-collected aggregate data sets, however I also have some experience with Big Data and Survey Data.
Iâ€™m fairly new to the Open Science environment, and I am most interested in learning about data management, preregistration and reproducibility.
