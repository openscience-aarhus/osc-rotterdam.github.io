      <description>Open Science Community Rotterdam (OSCR) is part of the International Network of Open Science and Scholarship Communities (INOSC). While every community is unique, we share a set of Guiding Principles and adhere to a Code of Conduct. Please find version 1.0 below.
Guiding Principles  Open Science/Scholarship Communities (OSCs) are bottom-up platforms by and for researchers to exchange knowledge and know-how on open science practices OSCs are inclusive  Researchers are the target audience of OSCs, but students, researcher supporters, and others that are interested in (conducting) research are also welcome to join the community No prior knowledge is required to be part of the community, nor are members in any way required to commit to certain open science/scholarship practices   OSCs organize, promote, and facilitate open science/scholarship events to (1) learn about and discuss open science/scholarship practices; (2) share open science/scholarship knowledge; and (3) build professional networks  Events are open to members and non-members and, if possible, are free-of-charge Attendees and organizers of events organized by OSCs should adhere to the Code of Conduct (see below)   OSCs promote critical discussions of pro’s and con’s of open science/scholarship practices.</description>
