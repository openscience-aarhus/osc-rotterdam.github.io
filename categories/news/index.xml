      <description>On September 24th I will give a workshop on how to use the Open Science Framework (OSF), a collaborative web tool allowing scholars from all disciplines to upload and share the products of their research, e.g., data, materials, analysis protocols, and article preprints.
I have already given a similar workshop at the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration at Ghent University and the Erasmus Research Institute of Management here at EUR.</description>
